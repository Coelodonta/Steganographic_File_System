Heloise,
Could I have imagined that a letter not written to yourself could have 
fallen into your hands, I had been more cautious not to have inserted 
any thing in it which might awaken the memory of our past misfortunes. I 
described with boldness the series of my disgraces to a friend, in order 
to make him less sensible of the loss he had sustained. If by this well 
meaning artifice I have disturbed you, I purpose here to dry up those 
tears which the sad description occasioned you to shed: I intend to mix 
my grief with yours, and pour out my heart before you; in short, to lay 
open before your eyes all my trouble, and the secrets of my soul, which 
my vanity has hitherto made me conceal from the rest of the world, and 
which you now force from me, in spite of my resolutions to the contrary.
